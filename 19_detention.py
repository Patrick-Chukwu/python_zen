# To loop through a code a specific number if times, we can use for loop and the range function.

# The range function generates a sequence of numbers, typically starting from 0 and ending at a particular number(exclusive).
for i in range(6):
    print(i*2)




for i in range(101):
    print("I will not use Snapchat in class")
